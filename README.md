# NER_PROJECT

## Deep Learning for data extraction in scientific literature

### Purpose

Model a token classification problem in the context of randomized controlled trial literature to support evidence-based medicine. Apply and analyze results from deep learning models in the task of named entity recognition (NER). Finally assess and summarize the project results in relation to aims, methods and available data.

### Models considered to tackle this project:

1. Bi-LSTM
2. Transformer
